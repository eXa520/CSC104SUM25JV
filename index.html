             <p>
                In a patchwork coat of black and white,
You prowl the house from day to night,
A whiskered king with emerald eyes,
A velvet shadow in disguise.

You curl beside the window’s light,
Chasing sunbeams out of sight,
With purrs that rumble soft and low,
My gentle friend, sweet Oreo.

Your paws are silent, swift, and sure,
A hunter’s grace, a heart so pure,
You greet me with a gentle mew,
As if to say, “I missed you too.”

From tangled yarn to feathered toys,
You fill my days with simple joys,
A biscuit-maker on my chest,
In your warm love, I am blessed.

So here’s to you, my dappled friend,
With every purr, my cares you mend,
A perfect blend of black and white
My Oreo, my heart’s delight.
             </p>
